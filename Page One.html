		This is my first website i used Notepad++ for typing this html, i am going to use Sourcetree to upload this html file into github
		the name of the folder in github is going to be Page one
		<br />
		Trying some push using Sourcetree but finding it difficult to push it all buttons are disabled
		<br />
		Finally pushed my html page to github. The reason i was not able to push it i didn't give any comment in commit and clicked the Commit Button <br>
		now i found that commit button at the bottom of the screen and given commit and clicked it and able to see the file in github
		<br>
		now got the local copy and doing this change after that i will push this change into the new branch. After that will merge with my master copy <br>
